    <!-- Pseudo-classes in CSS are used to define a special state of an element. 
    Pseudo-classes in CSS:
        :hover        → When the mouse pointer is over the element
        :focus        → When the element is focused (e.g., input clicked)
        :active       → When the element is being clicked or activated
        :first-child  → Selects the first child element of a parent
        :nth-child(n) → Selects the nth child element (replace n with a number)
        :visited      → Styles links that the user has already visited -->
